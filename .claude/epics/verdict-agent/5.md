# Task: Agent B (Execution)

## Description

Implement Agent B, the Execution Agent, which takes Agent A's verdict and produces an actionable execution plan. Agent B must accept the verdict without dispute and focus solely on minimal execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ExecutionAgent struct with `Process(verdict *VerdictOutput) (*ExecutionOutput, error)`
- [ ] System prompt engineered for minimal, actionable plans
- [ ] Output JSON schema: MVP scope, phases, done criteria
- [ ] No scope expansion or feature additions
- [ ] Bilingual support matching verdict language
- [ ] Agent cannot question or modify the ruling

## Technical Details

### Output Schema
```go
type ExecutionOutput struct {
    MVPScope     []string      `json:"mvp_scope"`
    Phases       []Phase       `json:"phases"`
    DoneCriteria []string      `json:"done_criteria"`
}

type Phase struct {
    Name  string   `json:"name"`
    Tasks []string `json:"tasks"`
}
```

### System Prompt Key Elements
1. "You are an executor, not a planner"
2. "Accept the ruling without question"
3. "Define MINIMUM viable scope only"
4. "Break into concrete, checkable tasks"
5. "Never suggest alternatives to the ruling"
6. "Output ONLY valid JSON matching the schema"

### File Location
`internal/agent/execution.go`

### Constraints
- Maximum 3 phases
- Maximum 5 tasks per phase
- Each task must be completable in < 1 day
- Done criteria must be measurable

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 002 (LLM Client) - for calling LLM

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Task 003)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] ExecutionAgent processes verdict successfully
- [ ] MVP scope is minimal (not exhaustive)
- [ ] Phases have concrete, actionable tasks
- [ ] Done criteria are measurable
- [ ] JSON output validates against schema
- [ ] Unit tests with mocked LLM responses
