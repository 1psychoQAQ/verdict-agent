# Project Vision

## The Vision

Create the definitive AI-powered decision engine that replaces human deliberation with deterministic verdicts, turning cognitive chaos into executable clarity.

## Core Philosophy

### What We Believe

1. **Decisions, not discussions** - People don't need more options; they need fewer
2. **Verdicts, not suggestions** - A judge rules; a consultant advises. We're building a judge.
3. **Artifacts, not conversations** - Output is state, not prose
4. **Constraints, not freedom** - Power comes from limitation, not expansion

### What We Reject

- The "also consider" mentality
- Infinite option generation
- Back-and-forth deliberation
- Scope creep by design

## Long-Term Direction

### Phase 1: MVP (Current)
Single-input → dual-artifact pipeline
- Prove the verdict model works
- Establish immutable decision pattern
- Simple but complete experience

### Phase 2: Integration
Connect to development workflow
- GitHub Issues export
- Project management integration
- Decision history tracking

### Phase 3: Domain Specialization
Vertical-specific verdict agents
- Technical architecture decisions
- Product prioritization
- Resource allocation

### Phase 4: Team Decisions
Multi-stakeholder verdict resolution
- Input aggregation
- Conflict resolution through ruling
- Team alignment artifacts

## Strategic Priorities

1. **Preserve constraint discipline** - Never add "maybe" features
2. **Maintain artifact immutability** - Decisions stay frozen
3. **Resist feature creep** - Every addition must pass verdict test
4. **Keep UI minimal** - Display results, don't build dashboards

## Success Vision

A world where:
- Users stop asking "what should I do?" and start executing
- Decisions are made once, not relitigated
- Execution plans are immediately actionable
- The system says "no" more than "yes"

## Anti-Vision (What We Must Never Become)

- A general chatbot with decision features
- A brainstorming tool
- A balanced pros/cons generator
- A feature-rich project management suite
- An AI that says "it depends"
